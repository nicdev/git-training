### A few words before we start

This training assumes you have a Mac computer. If you don't, it'll still be useful but you'll need to make adjustments.

Most of the training focuses on using Git from the command line, with a repository on Github. We'll also cover some GUI options, but the intention is for you to learn the basics of the CLI.


### Terms

Some of the terms you'll hear (repeatedly) during the training session:

* Git: Duh! Git is a versioning system much like SVN. It allows teams (and even solo developers) to work on the same code base in a much more organized manner. The main difference with SVN is that it's decentralized (i.e. every collection of the code is hirerchally equal.)
* Repo: The collection of files that make up "the code."
* Branch: A version of your code that you can safely work on without messing up everyone else's work.
* Master: The main branch. It can be called anything, but everyone refers to it as _master_ by convention.
* Merge: Adding the code from one branch onto another.
* Push: A Git command that sends your code from your local repo, to a remote repo.
* Pull: A Git command that brings the code in a remote repo to your local repo.
* Commit: Once you like what you coded, make it stick.
* Clone: Make a copy of a remote repo.

There are many more terms, but you'll sure hear this ones a lot.

### Let's Get a Repo

In the future you'll likely create repos for your own projects on Github, but for this training session I've already took care of that.

Open a terminal and issue the following commands

```bash
git clone 
```
